/**
 * The whole design system, one barrel - every atom/molecule/organism/
 * template this package has, re-exported by name. `src/index.ts` (the
 * package entry point) is just `export * from "./components"`; anything
 * that needs several of these pieces (that entry point, a consuming app)
 * gets them all from this one import instead of one deep path per
 * component. A component inside this tree still imports a sibling
 * directly (e.g. `organisms/Sidebar` importing `atoms/Brand`), never
 * through this barrel - routing that through here would import the
 * whole design system just to reach one piece, and risks a cycle the
 * moment two components reference each other.
