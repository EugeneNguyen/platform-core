"""`BaseSerializer` - dynamic field selection + relation sideloading,
the same two ideas django-rest-framework's `dynamic-rest` package is
built around. Reimplemented against this platform's own conventions
(`?include[]=`/`?exclude[]=` naming, no dependency on dynamic-rest itself)
rather than vendored, since dynamic-rest hard-codes its own pagination/
routing opinions this platform already has its own answers for
(`EnvelopePageNumberPagination`, `?sort=`/`?q=` - see pagination.py/
filters.py).

Two behaviors:
- `?include[]=field`/`?exclude[]=field` control which declared fields
  actually serialize. A field listed in `Meta.deferred_fields` is left
  out unless explicitly included; any field can be excluded on request.
- `DynamicRelationField` wraps another `BaseSerializer` for a relation.
  It renders as a bare id (or list of ids for `many=True`) by default -
  "sideloading" it (naming it in `?include[]=`) swaps in the full nested
  representation instead. Usually paired with listing the relation's name
  in `Meta.deferred_fields`, so a plain list/retrieve stays cheap and a
  caller opts into the expensive nested representation explicitly.

    that should support dynamic field selection. `Meta.fields` lists
    every field this serializer CAN emit, same as plain DRF; the optional
    `Meta.deferred_fields` (a subset of `Meta.fields`) lists the ones left
    out unless explicitly named in `?include[]=`.

    `Meta.fields` is optional - omit it (and `Meta.exclude`) and every
    model field is emitted (DRF's own `fields = "__all__"`), same as
    declaring nothing at all. Still overridable: name `Meta.fields`
    explicitly to whitelist a subset.

    In that same auto-fields mode, every relation on the model - forward
    (FK/O2O) or reverse/many (the "_set" side, or M2M either direction) -
    is also auto-added, each wrapped as a `DynamicRelationField`. Only the
    to-many ones are auto-deferred too (as if hand-declared and listed in
    `Meta.deferred_fields`) - fetching those is an extra query per row
    (the N+1 `BaseViewSet.get_queryset` prefetches against), same
    "expensive, opt in" reasoning `Organization.memberships` was hand-
    deferred for originally. A to-one forward relation (a plain FK/O2O
    column already sitting on this row) stays un-deferred, rendering as
    a bare id by default same as `DynamicRelationField`'s own docstring
    describes - no reason to hide a column that's already there. This
    only fires for a related model that itself has a registered
    `BaseSerializer` (keyed by `Meta.model` as subclasses are defined); a
    relation with no serializer to sideload is left as DRF's plain
    default (bare pk for a forward relation, absent for a reverse one),
    same as before.

    `Meta.auto_exclude` drops named fields outright, permanently - unlike
    `?exclude[]=`, which is a per-request opt-out a caller can undo simply
    by not passing it. Only meaningful alongside auto-fields mode (plain
    `Meta.fields`/`Meta.exclude` already whitelist/blacklist directly).
